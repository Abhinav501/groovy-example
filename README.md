2. Installation and execution



3. Design choices

While the coding example is rather small I deliberately chose a structured approach where:
- There is a parser class for each data file that needs parsing.
- There is a model class for each type of data objects collected from the parsed files.
- There are unit test for every class of the project.
- There are integration test to test the flow of the application.
